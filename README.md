## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Basic HTML/CSS training after some time with no coding at all.

Adding different images for each screen size using srcset:

```html
<source srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg" media="(min-width: 600px)">
```

### Useful resources

- [Picture element - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) - This helped me with changing the images for different screen size.
